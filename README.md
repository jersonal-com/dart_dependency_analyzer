# dart_dependency_analyzer

A command-line tool to analyze Dart/Flutter project dependencies and provide a health overview using a traffic light system.

## Features

-   **Dependency Analysis:** Scans `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock` to identify direct, dev, and transitive dependencies.
-   **Traffic Light System:** Assigns a color (Green, Yellow, Red) to each dependency based on its health:
    *   **ðŸ”´ Red:**
        *   Package is discontinued on pub.dev.
        *   Package has not been updated for more than a configurable number of months (`--stale-threshold-months`).
        *   A major version update is available.
    *   **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow:**
        *   A minor version update is available.
    *   **ðŸŸ¢ Green:**
        *   Package is up-to-date (only patch updates available, or no updates).
        *   Package is whitelisted.
-   **Configurable Staleness:** Use the `--stale-threshold-months` option to define what constitutes a "stale" package (default: 12 months).
-   **Whitelist:** Use the `--whitelist` option to specify a comma-separated list of packages that should always be considered "Green" (e.g., `flutter,cupertino_icons`).
-   **Blocker Identification:** Attempts to identify which direct dependency of your project is preventing a transitive dependency from upgrading to its latest version. Currently, a heuristic is implemented to identify `device_frame` as a blocker for `freezed` when applicable.
-   **Show Details:** Use the `--show-details` flag to display additional information for each package, including current and latest version, last update date, likes, and downloads.

## Usage

To run the analyzer, navigate to the `dart_dependency_analyzer` directory and execute:

```bash
dart run bin/dart_dependency_analyzer.dart <path_to_your_dart_project> [options]
```

**Example:**

```bash
dart run bin/dart_dependency_analyzer.dart ../ai_helper --stale-threshold-months=6 --whitelist=flutter,cupertino_icons
```

## Development

This project is being developed iteratively. The goal is to provide a robust tool for dependency management.
