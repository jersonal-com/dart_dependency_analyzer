This document chronicles the development process of the `dart_dependency_analyzer` tool, highlighting key decisions, challenges encountered, and the iterative approach taken.

## Development Log

### Initial Setup and Core Functionality

-   **Objective:** Create a basic Dart command-line tool to list dependencies from `pubspec.yaml`.
-   **Challenges:** Initial attempts to use `dart create --template=command-line` failed due to an outdated template name. Corrected to `dart create --template=cli`.

### Iteration 1: Foundational Data Gathering & Core Commands

-   **Objective:** Expand dependency discovery to include `dev_dependencies` and parse `pubspec.lock` for all (direct, dev, and transitive) dependencies. Integrate `dart pub outdated --json`.
-   **Decisions:** Decided to parse `pubspec.lock` directly to get resolved versions and constraints. Utilized `Process.runSync` to execute `dart pub outdated --json` and `dart pub deps --json`.
-   **Challenges:** Initial parsing of `dart pub deps --json` output led to `type 'String' is not a subtype of type 'int' of 'index'` errors due to incorrect assumptions about the JSON structure. This required multiple debugging cycles and refinements to the parsing logic.

### Iteration 2: Fetching External Data from Pub.dev

-   **Objective:** Fetch package metadata (deprecation status, last updated date, likes) from `pub.dev` API.
-   **Decisions:** Used the `http` package for network requests. Implemented `getPackageInfo` to make API calls and parse JSON responses.

### Iteration 3: Implementing Traffic Light Logic & UI

-   **Objective:** Implement the Green/Yellow/Red traffic light system based on configurable rules and display colored output.
-   **Decisions:** Used `ansi_styles` for colored terminal output. Defined rules for Red (discontinued, stale, major update), Yellow (minor update), and Green (patch update, up-to-date, whitelisted). Implemented `--stale-threshold-months` and `--whitelist` options.

### Iteration 4: Handling Git and Path Dependencies & Improved Error Handling

-   **Objective:** Gracefully handle git and path dependencies, and improve error reporting for `pub.dev` API calls.
-   **Decisions:** Modified `getPackageInfo` to check the dependency source from `pubspec.lock`. If the source is `git`, `path`, or if `pub.dev` information cannot be fetched, the package is reported with a grey status. Refactored `main` function into `analyzeDependencies` for better readability and maintainability.

### Blocker Identification (Ongoing Challenge)

-   **Objective:** Identify the direct dependency of the root project that is preventing a transitive dependency from upgrading.
-   **Challenges:** This has proven to be the most complex and persistent challenge. Multiple attempts to implement `findBlocker` and `_findDirectRootDependency` have failed due to:
    *   **Incorrect parsing of `dart pub deps --json` and `pubspec.lock`:** Misunderstanding the exact structure and how to correlate information between these two sources.
    *   **String escaping issues with `write_file`:** When attempting to write large, complex Dart code blocks containing many single quotes, the `write_file` tool has repeatedly failed due to internal escaping problems, leading to `Invalid parameters provided` errors or syntax errors in the written file. This has created a frustrating loop of debugging and re-attempting.
-   **Current Strategy:** To break the cycle of `write_file` errors, the current strategy is to isolate the `findBlocker` logic into a separate file (`lib/src/blocker_finder.dart`). This allows for independent development and testing of this complex part of the code, and then a simpler integration into `main.dart`.

## Future Work

-   Refine blocker identification to be more accurate and robust.
-   Add options for different output formats (e.g., JSON, HTML).
-   Implement more sophisticated analysis rules (e.g., security vulnerabilities, popularity trends).
